# PokeTrading Web App

## Description

This is a project in development. You can host both the client and the server pages. Client is using `React 18` in `strict mode` with the library `react-router-dom` to order the components in routes.

Server is using NestJs with Prisma ORM, because it's requires less effort to be set up than TypeORM. Also, the DTOs for the established models in the `schema.prisma` file are ready for use. Once you understand how to use TypeORM, you'll realize, in my opinion, Prisma is way less tedious to configure and, thus, it'll save you a lot of time. It's marvelous.

## Tools used

Frontend: React 18 w/ react-router-dom
Backend: NestJS w/ Prisma ORM
